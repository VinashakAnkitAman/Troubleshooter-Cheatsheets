# Troubleshooter-Cheatsheets
The purpose of this project is to help people quickly start or execute their work by grabbing the subset of knowledge or commands they need. This is a cheat-sheet collection of daily life frequently used commands and options for various platforms and tools. We most of the times have worked on many of these technology and commands, but its hard to remember all of them when needed. The reason is pretty simple that we work on many projects throughout our career and the knowledge least used starts fading from our memory.
